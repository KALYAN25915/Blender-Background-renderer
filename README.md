run the bat script by opening

This script will prompt the user to provide blender scene file path to be rendered for example in the format  C:\blend\scenefile.blend
and output path as D:\blend\rendersfilename   format similar in output directory where we provide in output panel of blender file
Then start frame

if you use other version of blender then replace the blender renderer path in the script to the version of blender you use   :)
